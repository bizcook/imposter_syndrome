##imposter syndrome application

For this project (an imposter syndrome application), Biz will be providing unique users a place to go to vent their frustrations (and laugh), while also gaining perspective on how for theyâ€™ve come from a development standpoint. It will act as a sort of positive feedback loop for users to reflect on their learnings and to let go of what their current problem is.
